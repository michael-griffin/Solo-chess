An in progress chess site, modeled after the solo chess minigame on chess.com


Current Plans:

Solo Chess
- Choose levels, play through
- Save completion percent/fastest time per level?

Puzzles
- Choose Type/Difficulty
  - This would allow a short (and constant) description for puzzle types
- Get a 'hint' for next move
- After 3 failures, show solution on rightside?

Opening practice
- Choose from several openings. Give the correct next move
  - Within an opening: choose from several variations, must give correct completion
  - Implementation could be similar to puzzles (choose 'Category (opening)',
  then choose either a subset or have a random variation given to you)
